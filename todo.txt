- Command execution
- sync / async
- limit the amount of processes
- redirections
- logging

SYNC:
    cmd_run(...)
    runs the command and waits for it immediately
    return the PID

ASYNC:
    cmd_run(...)
    run the command and do not wait
    return the pid / put the pid in an array f PIDs

    There should be some other function that later
    waits for all the async processes to finish
